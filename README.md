# Invert-Game
Invert is a 2D space shooter where the movement controls flip every time you shoot. It is a game I made in 2016 during my summer vacation. 
I had prior Unity experience but only in 3D. I was learning Unity from a book and there was a project to make a simple space shooter. 
I really wanted to go further with the idea and so I came up with the invert mechanic and ran forward with it, making a complete game. 
With this project I learned 
  * a) Unity in 2D 
  * b) how to motivate myself and 
  * c) Being innovative by applying restrictions
